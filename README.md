Small personal website with short bio and resume. 

##Assignment details##
All assignment guidelines have been followed as specified. I took
liberties with the formatting of work experience in resume.html to better fit
the design and layout. Assignment took approximately 4 hours to complete. 

##Special thanks to:##
Matt Brown's sampleresumetemplate.net. His template is based on Yahoo's YUI
CSS reset and grid framework. I did a complete CSS overhaul and made several
changes to the design to get rid of the external dependency and make the 
layout and formatting more consistent. 

Caleb Ogden's cssbutton.me, which provided a nice-looking button style for the 
homepage.
